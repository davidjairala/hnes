# Hacker News Enhancement Suite

Little enhancements for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).

Name blatantly stolen from the awesome [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).

Although the hope is for this to one day offer as many enhancements and awesomeness as its namesake for [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/), so far it's just a new color scheme that's somewhat easier on the eyes, bigger fonts (I'm 30 and my eyes ain't what they used to be), and changing the up and down arrows for ASCII characters so they don't pixelate on bigger font-sizes.

## Installation

1. Download/clone the project onto your machine.
2. Enter the following URL on Chrome: `chrome://chrome/extensions/`

4. Click on the `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` button.
5. Select the `hnes` folder on your drive.
6. Make sure the `Enabled` checkbox is checked for it.
7. Good to go!
